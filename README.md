# Symptom-AI
Developed an AI system using SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers to predict diseases from symptoms with 100% accuracy on test data.

# Overview
The AI-Based Disease Prediction System is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on input symptoms. Utilizing advanced classification algorithms, the system achieves high accuracy and provides reliable predictions that can assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

# Features
Multi-Model Predictions: Combines predictions from Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers.

High Accuracy: Achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset, validated through a confusion matrix.

User-Friendly: Accepts symptoms as input and outputs predictions from individual models and a combined prediction.

Visualization: Includes visual representations of data distribution and model performance.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Platform: Implemented using Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle
